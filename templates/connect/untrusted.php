	You chose not to grant trusted party status to Pitt, thus not allowing the university to access your ORCID iD. 
	Allowing Pitt to be a trusted party will help you and the university maintain accurate records of your research outputs within Pitt systems such as the Faculty Information System and D-Scholarship@Pitt.
	If you would like to grant Pitt trusted party status or add information to your ORCID profile, please <a href="/connect">restart this process</a>.
